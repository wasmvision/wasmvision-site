  About outputting video or images from wasmVision.
---

wasmVision can output the results or processing to a stream or video file.

## MJPEG

By default, wasmVision outputs an MJPEG stream so you can easily view the final output from processing.

## File

You can also configure wasmVision to output to a video file.

## Stream

wasmVision allows you to output to a video stream, thanks to including FFMpeg.
