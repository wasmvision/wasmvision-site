  Using wasmVision an an MCP Server
---

wasmVision includes experimental support for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/) by providing a [(MCP) Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/specification/draft/server/).

The MCP server implementation uses the "HTTP with SSE" transport to facilitate being used in various networking related scenarios.

See [using the wasmVision MCP Server](/docs/guides/mcp) for more information.

Also see the [MCP Server Resource list](/docs/reference/mcp).
