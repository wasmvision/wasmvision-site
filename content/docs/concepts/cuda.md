wasmVision includes experimental support for GPU acceleration using [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

The current implementation is only to [accelerate processing of DNN models](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Deep-Learning-in-OpenCV).

In addition, at present support is Linux amd64 support only.

See [Using CUDA with wasmVision](/docs/guides/cuda) for more information.
