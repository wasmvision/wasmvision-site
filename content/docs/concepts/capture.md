  About capturing video using wasmVision.
---

You can capture video data from a webcam, from data files, or from a stream. 

wasmVision has built-in support for [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) on Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.

wasmVision also includes built-in support for [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) on Linux systems.

See our [guide on how to capture video](/docs/guides/capture) for more information.
